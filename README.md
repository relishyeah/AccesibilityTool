I am currently losing my sight due to Stargardt disease, a form of early onset macular degeneration. I've started to learn to use NVDA, but while I've found the features great for some things, I wanted a little more control with webpages.

When `ctrl + alt + space` is pressed, reads whatever is in the clipboard, and continues if something new is copied while reading.


##Commands
Currently, all commands must be entered during standby, while the program is not reading.
